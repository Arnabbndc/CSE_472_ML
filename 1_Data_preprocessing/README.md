# Assignment 1: Data Preprocessing

## Overview

This assignment focuses on data preprocessing techniques applied to the HR Employee Attrition dataset. The goal is to clean, transform, and prepare the data for further analysis and modeling.


## Files

- **Data_preprocessing.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the data preprocessing steps.
- **WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv**: The dataset used for preprocessing.

## Data Preprocessing Steps

1. **Loading the Data**:
    - The dataset is loaded using pandas.
    - Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure.

2. **Handling Missing Values**:
    - Identification of missing values.
    - Imputation of missing values using mean for numerical columns.

3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**:
    - Conversion of categorical variables to numerical using Label Encoding.

4. **Feature Scaling**:
    - Standardization and normalization of numerical features using `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler`.

5. **Removing Duplicates**:
    - Identification and removal of duplicate rows.

6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Visualization of data distributions and relationships between features.

## How to Run

1. Open the 

Data_preprocessing.ipynb

 notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells sequentially to perform data preprocessing steps.

## Results

- The dataset is cleaned and transformed, ready for further analysis and modeling.
- Summary statistics and visualizations provide insights into the data.

## Conclusion

This assignment demonstrates essential data preprocessing techniques, which are crucial for preparing data for machine learning models. The cleaned dataset can now be used for building predictive models in subsequent assignments.
